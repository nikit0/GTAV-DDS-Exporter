This is a copy of the original plugin, with the purpose of adding support for GTA V / FiveM's texture format.

# Installation:

Extract the GTAV-DDS-Exporter.py into your Substance Painter Plugin folder:

<pre>
C:\Users\username\Documents\Adobe\Adobe Substance 3D Painter\python\plugins
</pre>

(Can also be found using the Python > Plugins Folder button in the top row)

## Export preset:

Move the GTA V.spexp from the optional files to this folder:

<pre>
C:\Users\username\Documents\Adobe\Adobe Substance 3D Painter\assets\export-presets
</pre>

## Enable the GTAV-DDS-Exporter under the Python menu

First time running the plugin it will ask you what folder the Texconv.exe is located in via a UI pop-up. This will create a GTAV-DDS-Exporter.ini in the plugin folder with the settings saved.
